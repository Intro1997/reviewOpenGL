&emsp;&emsp;In this tutorial, I find some mistakes that wil will make an wrong effect( in my device I get a black window and I use the same code with tutorial). I don't know whether it will happen on window devieces, but on my MacBook, I get this wrong effect.
&emsp;&emsp;When I use framebuffer to do off screen rendering, I find something strange when I move forward or backward. The moving path isn't a stright line but has a little offset in y axis. And when you use off screen rendering many times, the offset will accumulate and finally get wrong effect. The solution is use ```glViewPort(0, 0, SCR_WIDHT, SCR_HEIGHT)``` before you render to framebuffer and use 
```glViewPort(0, 0, SCR_WIDHT * 2, SCR_HEIGHT * 2) // (multiply 2 because of the retina screen)``` before use default framebuffer.
